Create a basic Apex test data factory that can generate  Accounts (2), Contacts (3), and Opportunities (3) with sensible default values. Include example test methods that use the factory and explain how it helps keep tests clean and maintainable.

Deploy the metadat to my org using the Salesforce DX MCP Server.
