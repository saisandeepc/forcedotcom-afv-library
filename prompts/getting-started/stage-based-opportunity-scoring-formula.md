Create a formula field on `Opportunity` that assigns a numeric score based on the StageName (for example, higher scores for later stages). Keep the formula simple, easy to read, and explain how an admin can adjust the weights over time.

Deploy the metadat to my org using the Salesforce DX MCP Server.

Provide instruction on how to set field level security for my profile and add the new field to the page layout.
