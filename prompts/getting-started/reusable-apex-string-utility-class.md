Create an `StringUtils` Apex utility class with common string helpers such as isBlank, trimToNull, and safe string-to-integer conversion. Include a focused test class that covers each helper method with both typical inputs. Do not test for edge casees at this time.

Deploy the classes to my org and run the unit tests, using the Salesforce DX MCP Server.
