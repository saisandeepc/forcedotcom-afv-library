Create a "Compliment Mixer" app that allows users to generate and save personalized compliments. Create a custom UI so the user can enter two adjectives that describe a person (e.g., "brilliant", "fearless") and a name (e.g., "Alex"). The app then generates a compliment sentence that combines those words and the name using a random sentence template. The user can save the compliment to Salesforce and view a list of the 5 most recent compliments they've generated.

The code should follow standard Salesforce styling and development best practices and be deployable to a scratch org or sandbox. Keep it fun, readable, and beginner-friendly.
